Though many additions were included, the overall design of the image processor generally remains identical. Several methods were added such as getHistogram() to complement new functionalities, otherwise, little was changed.

Added classes include interfaces FeaturesController and GUIView as well as their implementations. Supplemental classes (CommandsPanel, HistogramPanel, ImageNamesPanel,and ImagePanel) were added to help organize the GUI's layout. Each of these classes implements required aspects of the GUIView as detailed by the assignment.
