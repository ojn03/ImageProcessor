To use the Image Processor, first choose an image to upload. A fruits image is offered as the default image as well as in the res folder. The Processor will not allow you to start until you choose an initial image to upload. Everything else is pretty intuitive. 

* To apply a command, pick a command from the commands panel. Dialogs will guide you through the proper inputs and if an error occurs, a message popup will display it. 

* The image names panel allows you to choose which image you would like to view or edit. Clicking the image's name will show its picture as well as the associated histogram.

* The Histogram Panel shows rgb components in their respective line colors, and intensity component in black. The y axis displays the frequency, and the x axis displays the value.
It updates automatically depending on the current image that is showing
